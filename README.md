-Autosave Feature For DS1R Watchdog

Due to being flagged as a false-positive on Nexus; all files necessary for the auto save feature of Watchdog along with the executable program that allows you to easily reload your last Watchdog save have been uploaded here. To use this feature of Watchdog just put the "Watchdog Save" folder in your game directory and change the first line of the "WDSaveLocation.txt" to your DS1R save file location and save the file and Watchdog should automatically save your DS1R save file any time you enter a new session so you can reload it to its state before your last online session if you choose to do so.
